                    <h1>Statue of Sveta Sofia</h1>
                    <p>The statue, erected in 2000, stands in a spot once occupied by a statue of Lenin. Sophia was considered too erotic and pagan to be referred to as a saint. 24 feet in height, the copper and bronze statue by the sculptor Georgi Chapkanov, stands on a 48 feet high pedestal. Adorned with the symbols of power (crown), fame (wreath) and wisdom (owl), the crown is also a reference to the Goddess of Fate â€“ Tyche, inspired by the old emblem of Sofia dating back to 1900.</p>

                        <p>The National Assembly is the unicameral parliament and body of the legislative of Bulgaria.
                            The National Assembly was established in 1879 with the Tarnovo Constitution.
                            The National Assembly's main building has been proclaimed a monument of culture for its historic significance. Situated in downtown Sofia, it was designed in Neo-Renaissance style by Konstantin Jovanovic.</p>

                    <h1>Vasil Levski National Stadium</h1>
                    <p>Named after Bulgarian national hero and revolutionary Vasil Levski, the stadium is the country's second largest stadium. The stadium has 43,230 seats and is located in the centre of Sofia, on the territory of the city's oldest and most famous park - the Borisova gradina. The Bulgaria national football team's home matches and the Bulgarian Cup finals are held at the venue, as well as athletics competitions. It was used as the home venue for Levski Sofia's Champions League games, and is often used for important derbies between the big clubs from Sofia, instead of their own home stadiums.</p>
